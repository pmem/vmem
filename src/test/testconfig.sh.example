# For tests that require raw dax devices without a file system, set a path to
# those devices in an array format. For most tests one device is enough, but
# some might require more.
#
# For big sizes of DAX devices, some tests ran against Valgrind might fail due
# to length of anonymous mmap and Valgrind limitations. Maximum possible length
# is being calculated each time testconfig.sh changes. Tests which require more
# than detected maximum possible length are skipped.
#
# It is required to have R/W access to these devices and at least RO access
# to all of the following resource files (containing physical addresses)
# of NVDIMM devices (only root can read them by default):
#
# /sys/bus/nd/devices/ndbus*/region*/resource
# /sys/bus/nd/devices/ndbus*/region*/dax*/resource
#
# Note: some tests require write access to '/sys/bus/nd/devices/region*/deep_flush'.

# Overwrite available build types:

# (floating point number with an optional suffix: 's' for seconds (the default),
# 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days)

# Normally the first failed test terminates the test run. If KEEP_GOING

# This option works only if KEEP_GOING=y, then if CLEAN_FAILED is set
# all data created by test is removed on test failure.
